Basic login functionality is set up.

Need to properly pass user object for logged in user across different views (homepage, login page for a redirect if already logged in) to dynamically display differnet features of the message board. (ALMOST DONE - NEED TO CONFIRM WORKS WITH FULL MESSAGE IMPLEMENTATION)

Need to popualte the DB with users and messages to test the user login view limitations
